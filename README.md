Here the  Python Scripts  are there for 
1: System Health Monitoring Script:
Develop a script that monitors the health of a Linux system. It should check
CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of
these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the
script should send an alert to the console or a log file.

2: Log File Analyzer:
Create a script that analyzes web server logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx) for
common patterns such as the number of 404 errors, the most requested
pages, or IP addresses with the most requests. The script should output a
summarized report.
